## PersonalLib

- This repo is a personal library of mine, which contains codes that I used when working as a Unity developer.
- Under ADT folder there is some abstract data types.
- Under ExtComponent folder there are some extended components of the Unity UGUI framework. Most of those componenets are coded for implementing reactive UI and dynamic visual effects.
- Under utility folder there are some files containing tools.
