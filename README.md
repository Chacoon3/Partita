## PersonalLib

- This repo is a personal library of mine, which contains codes that I used when working as a Unity developer.
- Under ADT folder there is some abstract data types.
- Under ExtComponent folder there are some extended components based on the Unity UGUI framework. Most of those componenets are coded for implementing reactive UI and dynamic visual effects.
- Under utility folder there are some utility functions.


####
- The native UGUI framework features imperative style, meaning that the extended components of it are usually also implemented in imperative style, yet the encapsulation makes them able to be used in a declarative way.
